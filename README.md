## Design

### Design Choices

The design of the site is a bright colorful site which is done through imagry , that has a simple text disply for logo, nav bar , footer with selected content in each page with a white background on selected spaces to amplify the imagry. 
On the index.html page there is a grey opacity with the color rgba(0,0,0,0.35) just to bounce out the text and imagry



### Color

- Dark Green
- White
- backgroound shade of rgba(0,0,0,0.35)

All colours above were used as simple and basic colors on the basis of keeping it as close to the general relation of the meaning of the word organic.

<details><summary>Dark Green Colour </summary>
<img src="docs/images/dark-green-color.png">
</details>


### Fonts

Logo:
font-family: 'Cormorant Infant', serif;: 

I used the cormorant infant font, with a backup of serif. I liked the slim simple design on the basis that i dint want to overcrowd the navigation bar on the understanding of the placement of the a selectors being underneath 

### H1,H2:

font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif;

The headings used the 'Source Serif Pro' font, with a backup of serif. The slim design was neat and simple. Probably could be thicker for hard of sight

### P:

The paragraphs used the font-family: 'Tinos', serif; */ i think it stands out maybe a little too much but it is easily read



### Structure

. Home page (which has a nav bar and logo which is simply laid out easy to use, a footer with all social links and information on the fruit, what we do and how we do it)
.Products page (which has an arraw of products from fruit boxes to cold pressed juices)
. Gallery page ( which has an array of images that float out and have the option of a full size image on click to view in a preview window)
- Contact page ( which has a name, email,phone no, and comments section)
