## Design

### Design Choices

The design of the site is a bright colorful site which is done through imagry , that has a simple text disply for logo, nav bar , footer with selected content in each page with a white background on selected spaces to amplify the imagry. 
On the index.html page there is a grey opacity with the color rgba(0,0,0,0.35) just to bounce out the text and imagry



### Color
- Dark Green
- White
- backgroound shade of rgba(0,0,0,0.35)

All colours above were used as simple and basic colors on the basis of keeping it as close to the general relation of the meaning of the word organic.

### Fonts

Logo:
font-family: 'Cormorant Infant', serif;: 

I used the cormorant infant font, with a backup of serif. I liked the slim simple design on the basis that i dint want to overcrowd the navigation bar on the understanding of the placement of the a selectors being underneath 

### H1,H2:

font-family: 'Source Serif Pro', serif;

I used the 'Source Serif Pro' font, with a backup of serif. The slim design was neat and simple. Probably could be thicker for hard of sight

### P:
font-family: 'Tinos', serif; */
